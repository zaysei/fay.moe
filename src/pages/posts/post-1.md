## Why Use Astro?

1. **Installing Astro**: First thing first, installing Astro is a breeze. It is as simple as `yarn create astro` or `npm create astro@latest`; these commands will have you set

2. **Making Pages**: One of the greatest and most notable features of Astro is its ability to create what they call "Pages." Pages are an amazing way of quickly creating a web page via a markdown file.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: Commonly found in the MarkdownPostLayout.astro file, you can create a style that all Pages will have, specifically these markdown pages, and you can quickly and easily deploy a blog post just by typing some simple text, like I am doing here!
