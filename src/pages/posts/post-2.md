## The History
Web frameworks have existed for decades now, and you may be surprised that this dates back to even the 1990s, right in the prime of what many would call the "Internet boom." ColdFusion, still around today, was introduced in 1995 and was beloved by many. Since then, there has been a new one every year it seems, with many offering specific use cases for a developer.

## Frameworks Today
There are plenty of frameworks to choose from today with a use case that will fit the need of any web developer in existence. Astro is a framework that stands out among others like React or Vue because of its use of use of their Pages and their "Islands."

"Islands" for Astro is their way of prioritizing web performance by not running any JavaScript on a page until it is needed; originally, they were the ones to introduce this idea and many frameworks have used it since.

React is one of the most popular frameworks now, and is very general purpose. It is a safe assumption that if you need to make a website, React will do just fine. But with a framework like Astro, you are given the ability to further enhance your website and make it much better for the end user as well as the developer.

In Astro, an "Island" refers to a UI component on a page.
