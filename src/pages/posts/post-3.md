## Publishing this Website
Publishing this website was a straight-forward and well worth it task. By publishing this website, billions can access it if they so please (though GitHub would probably ban me if they did). GitHub is a platform that allows for code sharing among other things such as publishing of an application for people to download. It is often seen as your one-stop-shop for all things open source, though there does exist other options such as GitLab.

With GitHub, you are allowed to publish your website via their "GitHub Pages" feature; you can even view mine [here](https://fay.moe)!

## Buying my Domain
Buying my domain was simple, I used [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com) to purchase a domain that would suit my website, and it is also what I used to ensure that my DNS records were correct so that I could direct my github.io link and my website contents to my desired domain. There are many places to purchase a domain, though, and the most common ones would be [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com), [Name.com](https://name.com), and [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com).

Below is an image of the Pages section in the GitHub repository.
