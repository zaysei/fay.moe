## JavaScript Elements && Mobile Friendliness
As there is a huge focus on JavaScript elements and their performance handling with Astro Islands, I included two amazing ways to "showcase" the benefit, though it may not be as informative as it could be... So here is a table highlighting what difference the Islands make as opposed to no Islands (with the informative help of ChatGPT)!

<h2>Performance Comparison: Astro Islands vs No Astro</h2>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Aspect</th>
      <th>Astro Islands</th>
      <th>No Astro</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Page Load Time</td>
      <td>1.2s</td>
      <td>2.5s</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>JavaScript Bundle Size</td>
      <td>150 KB</td>
      <td>400 KB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Time to Interactive</td>
      <td>800ms</td>
      <td>1.8s</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>First Contentful Paint</td>
      <td>1.0s</td>
      <td>2.0s</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Overall Performance Score</td>
      <td>90%</td>
      <td>70%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

As you can see above, it is quite sigificant as showcased by Astro on their website as well. I have implemented a greeting button and a hamburger for mobile friendliness in this website so far.

**Below is a video of this greeting button in action.**
