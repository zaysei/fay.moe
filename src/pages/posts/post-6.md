## Base Layout File 
As shown in the screenshot, this file is the file that controls it all. It displays the header and the footer and ensures I do not have to call that to every single page but rather can just have it all called in this single file, allowing for not only easy debugging but also a cleaner look. It ensures the input of the `global.css` file as well and can prove to be very helpful for deploying additional pages to this website, need that be done.

## Thank you
... for following along in this "web design project" segment of my blog, there is much more to come! Stay tuned...
